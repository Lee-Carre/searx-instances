# The SearX instances list has moved to SearXNG
Please use this GitHub repository instead: https://github.com/searxng/searx-instances

## The reason of this change:
unixfox is **only** the maintainer of this list and he needed help by other people so he had to move to another GitHub repository where [more members](https://github.com/orgs/searxng/people) can maintain this list.
